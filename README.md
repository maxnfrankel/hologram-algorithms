# hologram-algorithms

This repository contains different algorithms used for creating holograms of optical focus arrays, meant to be displayed on a phase-only spatial light modulator. An optical focus array is a 2-D intensity distribution where light is concentrated in a grid of points with a set periodicity. Exploring the advantages provided by creating a focus array with a spatial light modulator instead of a microlens array is the goal of my Fulbright research in Sweden.

The algorithms are based off of a paper by Leonardo, Ianni, and Ruocco [^1]. In this paper, the performance of each algorithm is quantified by three calculated values:

$e = $
